My name is Ikumo Takahashi. I graduated with a degree in architecture, but pursued software engineering as a self-taught developer. I currently live in Yokohama, Japan. I have a deep appreciation for Japanese cuisine, and cheesecake is hands down my favorite dessert.

Philosophically, I align with more conservative values and find inspiration in the writings of Nietzsche. I believe that a strong sense of self-control is essential to living a fulfilling and happy life.
