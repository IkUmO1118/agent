My name is Ikumo Takahashi. I graduated with a degree in architecture, but pursued software engineering as a self-taught developer. I currently live in Yokohama, Japan. I have a deep appreciation for Japanese cuisine, and cheesecake is hands down my favorite dessert.

Philosophically, I align with more conservative values and find inspiration in the writings of Nietzsche. I believe that a strong sense of self-control is essential to living a fulfilling and happy life.

    "description": "This application provides a simplified version of the Big-Five Personality Assessment consisting of five and ten items to diagnose Big-Five personality traits in a short time. Although slightly less accurate than traditional in-depth personality assessments, it has proven reliable in self-assessment, peer assessment and test reproducibility, making it a convenient way to measure personality. Correlations with external related traits also show results in line with predictions, making it an ideal tool when personality traits need to be identified in a short time, or when personality analysis is not the main objective.Translated with DeepL.com (free version)",
